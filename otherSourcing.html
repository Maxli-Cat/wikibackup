<h1>General Sourcing guide</h1>
<p>Keeping a list of easy places for sourcing non-hormone ingredients&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distilled Water<ul>
      <li>Most grocery stores will have in gallon jugs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ethanol<ul>
      <li>When looking, proof = Â½% (ie 80 proof = 40% ethanol, 120 proof = 60%)</li>
      <li>Places that sell liquor should have everclear or similar, letting you get pure ethanol up to 60% or so</li>
      <li>Many places will sell denatured ethanol. <strong>DO NOT BUY THIS.</strong> Denatured means it has been made toxic&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Scientific suppliers will often sell 200 proof non-denatured, although they may require various forms of identification since alcohol is age restricted&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Isopropyl alcohol&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Can often be found 70%-97% at pharmacies and groceries&nbsp;<ul>
          <li>Currently supplies are still limited due to the pandemic&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can be found easily up to 99.97% online on amazon and similar&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Octisalate<ul>
      <li>Can be found on ebay for small quantities</li>
      <li>If you want a lot scientific suppliers can have better prices if the volume is high enough</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
