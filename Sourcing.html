<h1>Sourcing Advice</h1>
<h2>Estradiol</h2>
<p>You want to get 17 beta-estradiol powder <code>(CAS 50-28-2).</code> This is easy enough to find on alibaba, and you can usually get somewhere between $1-$5, plus shipping.</p>
<p>In the US, this is not a controlled substance, so there shouldn't be any legal or customs issues. In general, you should check your local laws rather than just trusting online strangers.</p>
