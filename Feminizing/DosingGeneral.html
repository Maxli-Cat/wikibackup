<h1>General dosing guide</h1>
<p>(this page is still incomplete and under construction)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General Advice</h2>
<p>There are three main routes to take:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With an dedicated anti-androgen</li>
  <li>With estrogen as your anti-androgen</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With anti-androgens</h3>
<p>With a dedicated anti-androgen, your primary concern is keeping your levels high enough to avoid symptoms like&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>headaches &amp; migrains</li>
  <li>depression</li>
  <li>fatigue</li>
  <li>mood swings</li>
  <li>trouble concentrating/"brain fog"</li>
</ul>
<p>as these are a sign of low sex hormones. If you are experiencing these, try slowly increasing your dose until you don't.</p>
<p>General advise is to start at the low dose, and step up the dose 3 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Estrogen as an anti-androgen</h3>
<p>When taken in high doses, estradiol can function as it's own anti-androgen. For this to work, it's recommended to start at the medium-high doses. After sufficient time (6-18 months), you may be able to reduce to medium doses. Similarly, if you've been on moderate dose E + anti-androgens for a similar time, you may be able to move to estrogen-only at a constant dose.</p>
<p>Worth noting if you're considering this plan, there is some reporting that very high doses, especially early on, can limit/stunt breast growth by causing duct fusion. This is under-studied, but is worth noting for people making decisions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This is not a conclusive guide, and I recommend doing sufficient research before starting. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/wiki/index">r/TransDIY wiki</a> has a good collection or resources to help you figure out what plan is best for you</p>
