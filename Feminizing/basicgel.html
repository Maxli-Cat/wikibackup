<h1>Guide to simple estradiol gel</h1>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<h3>Reusable</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Digital scale, at least 0.001g precision</li>
  <li>Rapid Stirrer<ul>
      <li>Can be either a lab-style magnetic stirrer or a food-grade milk frother</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dispenser<ul>
      <li>Airless cosmetic pumps are ideal, although other may be effective</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Estradiol<ul>
      <li>For more details, see sourcing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hand sanitizer<ul>
      <li>Make sure to get an alcohol-based sanitizer with no denaturing agents.</li>
      <li>Ideally in the 60%-70% alcohol range</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Solvent<ul>
      <li>Can use either isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (everclear), the higher the purity the better</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Distilled Water<ul>
      <li>Could probably use tap water in a pinch, but better safe than sorry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>(photo guide <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Tn6XIxa">https://imgur.com/a/Tn6XIxa</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/stae6x45nhnw0f6/EstrogelMath.xlsx?dl=0">Excel Sheet </a>for math</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Calibrate/Test your scale. Exact procedure for this varies scale to scale, check your manual</li>
  <li>Measure out you hand sanitizer. For this guide we're using 120g, but you can scale up or down</li>
  <li>Measure out your solvent. We're using 15g&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>For both of these measurements, these numbers are approximate targets. You numbers can vary Â±10%, but make sure to use your exact numbers when doing the math for later steps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculate the water required to bring the final solution to 63% alcohol. The excel sheet makes this easy, but you could do it by hand</li>
  <li>Measure the water and add it to the hand sanitizer</li>
  <li>Calculate the desired amount of E&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>This method should work with 0.6% to 0.12%. This guide targeting 0.1%</li>
      <li>Again, the excel sheet makes the math easier</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Measure out your E<ul>
      <li>This is often the hardest step, since it's measuring both a powder not a liquid, and a very small amount.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Go slow, and don't be afraid to start this step over</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the E to the solvent</li>
  <li>(Optional) add a drop of food coloring to the solvent.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Mix the E and solvent until the E is fully dissolved.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>You probably don't need the stirrer for this one, just shake until dissolved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mix the solvent into the hand sanitizer<ul>
      <li>Use the stirrer for this one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pour the fully mixed gel into your dispenser(s)</li>
  <li>Measure your dispenser's output<ul>
      <li>Best way I've found it to just measure out 10-20 pumps onto your scale, and take the average</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calculate dosing&nbsp;<ol>
      <li>The basic way to do this is <code>E target / (gel per pump * E concentration)</code></li>
      <li>So in my scenario, I want 2mg, I have a 0.1% concentration, and my pump puts out 0.22g, so I'd do <code>2mg / (220mg * 0.001)</code> which works out to 9 pumps</li>
      <li>This is also in the Excel sheet if you don't like math</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy :)</li>
</ol>
