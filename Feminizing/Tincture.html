<h1>Basic Tincture</h1>
<p>The idea is straightforward, since estradiol dissolves in ethanol, and you can drink ethanol, just drink your estradiol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>High concentration</h3>
<p>Making your tincture is very straightforward, get high proof drinking alcohol, 120 proof (60%) like everclear is best although as low as 80 proof (40%) like vodka would likely work.</p>
<p>Measure out your liquid and your estradiol, 1g of E per 100mL of drink. Mix until dissolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use, take 0.1mL of liquid per 1mg of E wanted. It's best to use something like a lab syringe or an insulin syringe to measure amounts this small. Squirt it under your tongue and don't swallow for a few minutes, and avoid eating/drinking/rinsing for a while</p>
<p>Note that dosing amounts here are <a href="/Feminizing/doseguide">sublingual, not transdermal&nbsp;</a></p>
