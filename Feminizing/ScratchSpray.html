<h1>Estradiol Spray</h1>
<p>This is one of the simplest recopies and should be very effective</p>
<p>It's based off the Lenzetto spray</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Estradiol</li>
  <li>octisalate</li>
  <li>ethanol<ul>
      <li>65%-70% ideal</li>
      <li>Water down with distilled water if yours is higher</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>spray bottle</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Making this is very straightforward</p>
<ul>
  <li>You want to get 5g of octisalate per 1g of estradiol</li>
  <li>Don't use more than 20mg estradiol per 1mL of ethanol</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make something functionally identical to off the shelf sprays, mix</p>
<ul>
  <li>estradiol: .17 g</li>
  <li>octisalate: .85 g</li>
  <li>ethanol: 8.98 ml</li>
</ul>
<p>Which gives 1.7mg per mL</p>
<p>This can have the concentration scaled up, keeping the estradiol and octisalate in proportion and reducing the ethanol to keep the final result at 100mL</p>
<p>And like all our formulas, it can be scaled up or down for a larger or smaller batch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Straightforward, spray on skin and leave that section alone until it drys. Note that additional successive sprays on the same patch of skin doesn't linearly increase dosage.<sup>1</sup> That means if you need more than one spray you should either mix a higher strength spray or use 2 patches of skin (ie both arms). It seems it's best to wait at least 6 hours between spraying the same spot</p>
