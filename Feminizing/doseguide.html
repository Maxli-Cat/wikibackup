<h1>A brief guide to dosing</h1>
<p>This isn't a comprehensive guide to hrt dosing, but one focused on diy gel and a practical overview</p>
<h2>Estradiol Comparative chart</h2>
<p>This is a simple chart of equivalence between methods, and can be used for converting from your current method to gel</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>1: These names taken relative to cis female levels, not typical hrt treatments.</p>
<p>2: Dissolved under the tongue or in the cheek, if you (like me) didn't know what these meant</p>
<p>3: This is for general skin application. Lower doses can be used on the more ideal parts of skin. Scrotal skin seems to be ideal, and armpits and face skin seem to be better than typical. This is still evolving science</p>
<h2>General Advice</h2>
<p>There are three main routes to take:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With an dedicated anti-androgen</li>
  <li>With estrogen as your anti-androgen</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>With anti-androgens</h3>
<p>With a dedicated anti-androgen, your primary concern is keeping your levels high enough to avoid symptoms like&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>headaches &amp; migrains</li>
  <li>depression</li>
  <li>fatigue</li>
  <li>mood swings</li>
  <li>trouble concentrating/"brain fog"</li>
</ul>
<p>as these are a sign of low sex hormones. If you are experiencing these, try slowly increasing your dose until you don't.</p>
<p>General advise is to start at the low dose, and step up the dose 3 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Estrogen as an anti-androgen</h3>
<p>When taken in high doses, estradiol can function as it's own anti-androgen. For this to work, it's recommended to start at the medium-high doses. After sufficient time (6-18 months), you may be able to reduce to medium doses. Similarly, if you've been on moderate dose E + anti-androgens for a similar time, you may be able to move to estrogen-only at a constant dose.</p>
<p>Worth noting if you're considering this plan, there is some reporting that very high doses, especially early on, can limit/stunt breast growth by causing duct fusion. This is under-studied, but is worth noting for people making decisions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This is not a conclusive guide, and I recommend doing sufficient research before starting. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransDIY/wiki/index">r/TransDIY wiki</a> has a good collection or resources to help you figure out what plan is best for you</p>
