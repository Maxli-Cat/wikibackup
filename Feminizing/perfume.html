<h1>Perfume based spray</h1>
<p>Many perfumes are ethanol with scents dissolved in them. It should be possible to also dissolve estradiol into the spray, making something similar to the <code>Lenzetto </code>spray.</p>
<p>Similar to the scratch spray, you should also use a penetration enhancer like <code>octisalate</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>Since perfumes are not uniform in production or spray volume, we can't give universal directions. This will just be general guidance</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can't go more than 20mg estradiol per 1mL of ethanol<ul>
      <li>To figure out how much you need, look at how much your dispenser sprays and what your dose is</li>
      <li>You should aim to get your whole dose in 1-2 sprays</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Octisalate should be 5x your estradiol, by mass</li>
  <li>63% ethanol is ideal, but it's a fairly shallow drop off so 60%-70% should be ok. 50%-80% would likely still work, but at reduced effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mix together your perfume, estradiol, octisalate, and distilled water as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Straightforward, spray on skin and leave that section alone until it drys. Note that additional successive sprays on the same patch of skin doesn't linearly increase dosage.<sup>1</sup> That means if you need more than one spray you should either mix a higher strength spray or use 2 patches of skin (ie both arms). It seems it's best to wait at least 6 hours between spraying the same spot</p>
